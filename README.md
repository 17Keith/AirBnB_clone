DESCRIPTION
AirBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interface. The purpose of this project is to make a command interpreter that manages our AirBnb objects.This project, done in pairs and is the first step into web application.

AirBnB Clone - The Console
The console is the first segment of the AirBnB project that collectively covers the fundamental concepts of higher level programming. The goal of AirBnB project is to eventually deploy our server a simple copy of the AirBnB Website(HBnB). A command interpreter is created in this segment to manage objects for the AirBnB(HBnB) website.

Functionalities of the command interpreter:
Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object

Installation:
Clone this repository: git clone "https://github.com/17Keith/AirBnB_clone.git"
Access AirBnb directory: cd AirBnB_clone
How to start it:
Run hbnb(interactively): ./console and enter command
Run hbnb(non-interactively): echo "<command>" | ./console.py




This project is done by Nelly Maina, and Keith Obando.
